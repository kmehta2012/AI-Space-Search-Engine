# AstroBio Explorer

AstroBio Explorer is our AI-powered research assistant built for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025(Build a Space Biology Knowledge Engine)**.
It helps anyone explore NASA’s space biology research in a simple, conversational and interactive way.

## 🌟 Inspiration

NASA has been studying how life behaves beyond Earth for decades. From how plants grow in space to how microgravity affects the human body, the knowledge is incredible.
But it’s buried inside hundreds of research papers that are hard to search and connect.

We wanted to make that exploration feel natural, like having a conversation with a scientist who knows exactly where to look. That’s why we built AstroBio Explorer.

---

## 🧭 What It Does

AstroBio Explorer turns complex scientific literature into a friendly research companion. Here’s what you can do inside it:

* 🧠 **Ask research questions** in plain language and get clear, well-grounded answers from NASA bioscience papers
* 🔗 **See inline citations** with clickable links to original publications
* 📄 **Explore related Google Scholar papers** using SerpAPI
* 🖼 **View relevant images** tied to your question in a sidebar
* 💬 **Keep multiple research threads open** using multi-session chat

It doesn’t just give you a block of text. It brings together papers, citations, images and related work so you can truly explore a topic.

## 🛠 How We Built It

We structured AstroBio Explorer into three main parts working together.

### 🧠 Backend (RAG + AI)

* Built with **FastAPI**, **LangChain**, and **Gemini 2.5 Flash**
* Parsed and chunked **608 NASA bioscience articles** at the sentence level
* Generated dense and sparse embeddings and stored them in **Qdrant** for fast retrieval
* Used a small agent system to combine the RAG pipeline with **Google Scholar** and **image search**, merging multiple sources for each response

### 🖥 Frontend (UI/UX)

* Built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**
* Clean chat interface with **SCSS and Haml animations** for a smooth space-themed feel
* Citations appear inline inside chat bubbles
* Images are shown in a sidebar for visual context using **Image Fetch API**(Serp API)
* Includes a **Google Scholar** button to fetch related papers(Serp API)
* Supports multiple chat sessions so users can explore different topics simultaneously

### 🧱 Data Layer

* Vector DB: **Qdrant**, storing each chunk with metadata like paper ID, section, and URL for precise citation linking
* Context + session storage: For multi-turn conversations and persistent threads

## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into

* Finding the **right chunk size** to keep answers precise without slowing the system
* Placing **inline citations** at exactly the right spots in the generated text
* Coordinating **Gemini**, **Qdrant** and **SerpAPI** in a single pipeline
* Designing a **UI** that could handle citations, media and multiple threads without feeling cluttered

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments We're Proud Of

* Built a working research assistant that connects **NASA data**, **Google Scholar** and **images** in one conversational interface
* Added **inline citations** that link directly to real papers
* Enabled **multi-session research chats** for parallel exploration
* Designed a **modular backend** that can easily be extended with more tools later

---

## 📚 What We Learned

* How to combine different AI components into a smooth, useful experience

## 🧪 Evaluation Overview

We tested AstroBio Explorer on **real NASA space biology literature** to measure how well it retrieves, cites and answers scientific questions.

* **181 questions**
* **42 research papers**
* Evaluation measured **retrieval**, **answer quality** and **citation accuracy**

### Results

* **Overall Score:** 72%
  (Weighted across retrieval, answer quality, and citation accuracy)

| Component         | Score | Notes                                           |
| ----------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Answer Quality    | 83%   | Excellent factual alignment with expert answers |
| Citation Accuracy | 70%   | Good relevance and proper linking               |
| Retrieval Quality | 59%   | Good but room for broader document recall       |

**Formula:**

```
Overall = 35% × Retrieval + 45% × Answer Quality + 20% × Citations
```

### Performance by Question Type

## 🔐 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file for the backend and a `.env.local` for the frontend.
Do not commit these files to Git. If you ever push them by mistake, rotate the keys immediately.

### Backend `.env` (create in `backend/.env`)

```ini
# LLM
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
MODEL_NAME=gemini-2.5-flash

# Vector DB
QDRANT_URL=https://your-qdrant-host:6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key
QDRANT_COLLECTION=space_bio_chunks

# External search
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_key

# CORS
ALLOW_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

### Frontend `.env.local` (create in `frontend/.env.local`)

```ini
# Your API base for local dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

```

### Git ignore tip

Make sure your root `.gitignore` includes:

```
.env
.env.local
**/.env
**/.env.local
```

## 🧭 How to Run the Project

### 1. Backend: create virtual environment

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Backend: activate virtual environment

macOS or Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Backend: install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Backend: set environment variables from `.env`

Make sure `backend/.env` exists with your keys. If you use a process manager it will load automatically. For local shells, you can also export manually if needed.

macOS or Linux:

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
  if ($_ -and $_ -notmatch '^\s*#') {
    $name, $value = $_.Split('=',2)
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($name.Trim(), $value.Trim())
  }
}
```

### 5. Backend: run the API

```bash
python main.py
```

The backend will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

### 6. Frontend: install dependencies

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 7. Frontend: run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
